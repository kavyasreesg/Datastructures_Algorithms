# Datastructures_Algorithms
My practice of DS and Algorithms using Python. </br>
This includes 
Built in python data structures like 
-> Lists
-> tuples
-> sets
-> dictionaries
And other data types like 
 Strings
, Customized data structures like 
-> Stacks
-> LinkedLists
-> Queues
-> Binary Tree
-> Binary Search Tree
-> Maxheap
-> Hashing
-> Graphs
-> Matrix
 And some coding challenges/ algorithms.
