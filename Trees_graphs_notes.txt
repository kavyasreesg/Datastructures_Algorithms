Binary Search Tree:

-> Each node can have up to two child nodes.
-> In BST, each node is greater than every node in its left subtree.
-> Also, each node is less than every node in its right subtree.

						15
			
				8				24
			
			5		11		19			28
		
		2		6		13			25
		
-> 15 is greater than 8,5,11,2,6,13 (all nodes in left subtree)
-> 15 is less than 24,19,28,25 (all nodes in right subtree)

Operations of BST:
-> Insert
-> Find 
-> Delete
-> get_size
-> Traversal
